                    My Name is Mherl Capistrano. I was born in the Phillippines,
                    and raised in Canada since the age of 7. My favorite activities
                    to do in my free time are playing video games, and volleyball.

                    Specifically I love the coding and software aspects of computers.
                    I love everything to do with computers which is why I am studying in the CNT 
                    program at Nait.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of right now I do not have any notable achievements. The reason
                    for this is because I'm still studying and have not started on
                    my Career.
